# NodeJS

It is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Javascript engine is the JS runner that needs a context to run. In Chrome the context is DOM and all operations are performed on it.
NodeJS is another context that gives the engine access to system resources and apis.
This means the JS engine can now control the file systems, networks, etc by running developer fed JS code.
